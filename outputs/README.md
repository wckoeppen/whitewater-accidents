- There are a large amount of "Other" factors listed here. These are not mutually exclusive with the other factors, and there's no listing of which factors were primary or secondary. I might pull "other" from this graph and just note that when one thing goes wrong, a lot of other things can go wrong too?
- Seems like it makes sense to combine "One Boat Trip" and "Inexperience"
