## Timeseries
![Number of accidents per year in the database](https://github.com/wckoeppen/whitewater-accidents/blob/main/outputs/latest-ts-count.png)
- As a crowd-sourced database, it's probably pretty incomplete so I'm not sure what can be drawn from this time series plot.
- For example, did accidents really mostly flatten out from 2005 to the present?
- Some of the individual entries also indicate locations or rivers that are hotspots of under-reported accidents (e.g., one entry suggests that American Whitewater contact a local Fire Department because they say that people are pulled from the river "daily" by their practice rescue team).

## Causes

## Factors

- There are a large amount of "Other" factors listed here. These are not mutually exclusive with the other factors, and there's no listing of which factors were primary or secondary. I might pull "other" from this graph and just note that when one thing goes wrong, a lot of other things can go wrong too?
- Seems like it makes sense to combine "One Boat Trip" and "Inexperience"
